    <h2>Different Advocacy</h2>
    <article>
        <h3>SKIN COLOR</h3>
        <p>In an increasingly globalized world, skin color should not be 
            a barrier to human connection and understanding. Unfortunately, 
            throughout history, society has often harbored biases against 
            individuals based on their skin color. This discrimination 
            perpetuates stereotypes and undermines the inherent dignity of 
            individuals. Advocacy for the acceptance and celebration of 
            diversity in skin color is essential for fostering reconciliation, 
            equality, and a just society. It is imperative that we address these
             biases, educate ourselves and others, and work collaboratively
              towards a future that embraces all shades of humanity.</p>

        <h3>WOMEN RIGHTA</h3>
        <p>Historically, women have faced systemic discrimination and
             marginalization, often denied basic rights such as education, 
             property ownership, and political participation. The women's
              rights movement gained significant momentum in the early 20th
               century, with landmark milestones like women’s suffrage 
               movements, the establishment of International Women’s Day, 
               and the adoption of significant treaties such as the Convention 
               on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women 
               (CEDAW) in 1979. While considerable progress has been made, 
               significant inequalities persist, necessitating a renewed 
               commitment to advocating for women's rights across the globe.
               Advocating for women's rights is a moral imperative that
                transcends borders, cultures, and ideologies. Gender equality 
                is not just a women's issue; it is a societal issue that affects
                 everyone. When women are empowered and given equal 
                 opportunities, societies thrive, economies prosper,
                  and the fabric of communities strengthens. As advocates, 
                  we must commit to challenging the status quo, raising our
                   voices, and uplifting the rights and dignity of women and
                    girls everywhere. By fostering a culture of equality and
                     respect, we pave the way for a just, inclusive, and 
                     prosperous world for generations to come. Let us all stand
 together in this essential fight for women's rights, ensuring that every 
 woman's voice is heard and valued.</p>

        <h3>UNFAIR SYSTEM</h3>
        <p>The criminal justice system is often heralded as a cornerstone 
            of democracy, intended to uphold the rule of law and protect 
            the innocent. However, the reality is that systemic inequalities 
            within this system continue to undermine its integrity. One of 
            the most troubling phenomena is the wrongful framing of 
            individuals for crimes they did not commit, a situation
             often exacerbated by socioeconomic disparities. Wealthy 
             individuals can manipulate legal outcomes, using their 
             resources to deflect justice while innocent people suffer
              the consequences. Advocating for a fair system that protects 
              the rights of all individuals, especially those wrongfully 
              accused, is crucial for achieving true justice and equality.
              The fight for a fair justice system is a call to action for
               all of us. The wrongful framing of individuals, especially
                those from marginalized communities, is an affront to the 
                principles of equality and justice on which our society is
                 built. Economic disparities must not dictate access to
                  justice or the outcome of legal proceedings. By advocating
                   for systemic reforms, raising awareness, and promoting
                    accountability within the justice system, we can work 
                    towards a society where every individual is treated
                     fairly and equitably, regardless of their socioeconomic 
                     status. Let us unite in the pursuit of justice, ensuring 
                     that the innocent are protected, the guilty held 
                     accountable, and the integrity of the legal system 
                     upheld for all.</p>
